## Inspiration
The recent natural disasters in California and North Carolina

## What it does
Provides an interactive map where users can post request for relief at a location of their choosing. These requests are displayed to others on the map where they can view details about the request. 

These requests fall into categories Food, Shelter, and Medical, and have links to sites such as go fund me for personal requests or American Red Cross for disaster relief funds.

The power of this app comes from enabling users to directly support members of their community in times of need.

## Challenges we ran into
- Hosting Angular frontend 
- Using a non-relational database with Django

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Learning new technologies such as Django and leaflet.js
- Competing in a multi-day hackathon for the first time
- Hosting our first application

## What we learned
- The importance of being able to build and host your application from the start and throughout a hackathon
- Find the right technology for the job instead of trying to hack n slash a technology to fit your needs (using base django as a restapi for a non-relational db)

## What's next for the Disaster Relief Community Platform
Expanding user customizability by adding the different relief requests to a watchlist and giving suggestions for different requests based on proximity and popularity. 

## Technologies Used
**Frontend** : Angular, tailwind, leaflet.js
**Backend** : Django, django-mongodb-backend, pymongo
**Database** : MongoDB Atlas
**Apis/Other** : Google Maps api for geolocation, Vercel for hosting the backend
